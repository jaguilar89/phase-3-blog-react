# Phase 3 Project
This is my Phase 3 project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering program. It is a simple blog written as a full stack web application using a React frontend and a Sinatra backend.
You can create a blog post as well as post comments on an individual blog post, all of which are stored in a local SQLite database and interface with the frontend via Sinatra.
